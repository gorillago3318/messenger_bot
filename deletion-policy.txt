5️⃣ Why Do We Need 12 Months to Process Deletion Requests?
At FinZo Advisory, we process housing loans, which can involve lengthy administrative processes related to loan approvals, property title transfers, deeds, and potential project delays. These processes can affect the availability of data required for review, analysis, and customer support. Therefore, to protect the continuity of our services and ensure operational efficiency, we retain identifiable data for up to 12 months. This allows us to maintain business integrity while complying with data protection laws.
