  "faq": {
    "en": {

      "1. what is a home loan (mortgage)?": "A home loan (mortgage) is a financing facility from banks or financial institutions to help you purchase or refinance a property. You repay principal and interest through monthly installments over a set tenure, typically up to 35 years or until age 70. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "2. what is refinancing and why should i consider it?": "Refinancing replaces your existing home loan with a new one—often to get better interest rates, lower monthly payments, or to cash out on increased property equity. It can free up funds for renovations, education, or help consolidate debts. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "3. how do i check my eligibility for a home loan or refinancing?": "Banks assess your credit score, income stability, and debt-to-income ratio. They also review CCRIS (repayment track record) and CTOS (legal or bankruptcy checks). A good credit history, stable income, and manageable debts improve eligibility. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "4. what documents do i need for a home loan or refinancing application?": "Common documents include Sales & Purchase Agreement or Title Deed, identification (IC/passport), income statements (salary slips, EA forms), bank statements (3–6 months), and current loan statements (if refinancing). Additional documents may be needed depending on the bank's requirements. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "5. what is the typical margin of financing (mof)?": "Most banks offer 70% to 90% margin of financing, sometimes up to 100% for certain schemes. The actual margin depends on your credit profile, property type, and bank policies. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "6. how do interest rates work (fixed vs. floating)?": "A fixed rate remains the same for a set period (2–5 years), providing predictable monthly payments. A floating rate (tied to BR, BFR, etc.) can fluctuate with market conditions. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "7. how do blr, br, bfr, and opr affect my mortgage interest rate?": "Banks use a Base Rate (BR) or Base Lending/Financing Rate (BLR/BFR) as reference. The Overnight Policy Rate (OPR), set by Bank Negara Malaysia, influences these rates. A change in OPR can cause banks to adjust their BR, affecting your loan’s interest rate. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "8. what is the typical interest rate range in malaysia?": "Generally around 3.0% to 4.5% per annum, depending on market conditions and borrower profile. Special promotions or packages may lead to even lower rates. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "9. how long does the loan application or refinancing process usually take?": "Typically 1 to 3 months, depending on document completeness, credit assessment, valuation, and legal processes. We coordinate closely with banks and lawyers to expedite approvals. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "10. what fees should i expect when applying for a home loan or refinancing?": "Fees include legal fees (0.5%–1% on a tiered scale), stamp duty (0.5% on loan amount), valuation fees, and possible bank processing fees. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "11. what about zero entry cost (zec) packages or financing legal fees?": "Some banks offer Zero Entry Cost (ZEC) packages, covering legal/valuation fees, or allow you to finance these fees. The trade-off can be slightly higher interest rates, but it reduces your initial cash outlay. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "12. what is a lock-in period, and why does it matter?": "A lock-in period (2–5 years) is when settling or refinancing your loan early incurs a penalty, often a percentage of the outstanding balance. It's crucial if you plan to refinance or sell your property soon. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "13. what are mrta/mlta, and do i really need them?": "MRTA (Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance) decreases coverage with your loan balance, while MLTA (Mortgage Level Term Assurance) maintains the same coverage. These policies protect your family against unpaid loans if you're unable to continue payments due to death or permanent disability. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "14. is there a difference between a conventional loan and an islamic financing package?": "Yes. Conventional loans charge interest, while Islamic financing follows Sharia principles (profit-sharing or rental). Both can offer competitive rates; the main differences are in structure, terminology, and legal agreements. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "15. how can i improve my chances of loan approval if i have a weak credit score?": "Pay bills on time to enhance your CCRIS history, reduce existing debts, and consider a joint application with a spouse or close family member. A better debt-to-income ratio can also boost approval odds. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "16. what if my application is rejected? can i reapply?": "Yes. First address the reasons for rejection—high debt, poor credit, insufficient income—and take corrective steps (pay down debts, fix credit issues). Then reapply when your profile is stronger. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "17. can i make partial or full settlements on my loan?": "Yes. You can settle partially or fully to reduce principal and total interest. Check if there's a lock-in period or early settlement fees. (Fun tip: making extra payments earlier in the loan tenure can shave off a good chunk of your interest over time!) For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "18. what are full-flexi and semi-flexi loan packages?": "Full-flexi allows you to deposit extra into your loan account anytime, reducing interest, with easy withdrawals. Semi-flexi is similar but may require extra steps or fees. It's great for borrowers with variable income or extra savings. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "19. what does the property valuation process involve, and why is it important?": "A licensed valuer assesses market value based on factors like location, recent transactions, and condition. Banks lend based on the lower of purchase price or valuation. If valuations come in lower, you may need to top up the difference. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "20. can i cash out (cash-out refinancing)?": "Yes. If your property's market value exceeds your loan balance, you can borrow more and take the difference as cash. The bank will assess repayment capability and property valuation. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "21. if i already have a home loan, can i switch banks for better rates?": "Yes, that’s refinancing. Switching banks can secure lower rates or a better package. Watch out for lock-in periods and any penalties, though. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "22. are there special schemes or stamp duty waivers for first-time home buyers?": "Yes. Occasionally, the government or banks offer stamp duty exemptions or special financing schemes (e.g., Home Ownership Campaign). Check with us for current incentives. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "23. what if the property is still under construction?": "You can get a loan with progressive release, where the bank disburses funds in stages. You only pay interest on the disbursed amount. Some developers offer interest-bearing schemes, but terms vary. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "24. what if i’m buying a property for investment (to rent out)?": "Investment properties can have stricter criteria and lower margins of financing. Rental income may be considered in eligibility, but banks often view it as higher risk. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "25. do i need fire insurance or house owner insurance?": "Yes, most banks require basic fire or house owner coverage to protect the property. MRTA/MLTA covers life/TPD aspects, while the property insurance protects against damages. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "26. what is a bridging loan and how does it differ from a standard mortgage?": "A bridging loan is short-term financing for buying a new property while waiting to sell an existing one or for properties under construction. Interest rates can be higher, and you'll typically switch to a standard mortgage once the old property sells or new one is completed. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "27. what is the difference between the letter of offer (lo) and the loan agreement?": "The Letter of Offer outlines key terms (interest, tenure, lock-in). Once you accept and sign it, the formal Loan Agreement is prepared by lawyers and then stamped. The Loan Agreement is legally binding. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "28. how does finzo ai simplify the loan or refinancing process?": "We assess your financial profile, recommend suitable packages across multiple banks, assist with documentation, coordinate valuations, and keep you updated at every stage. This saves you time and reduces complexity. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "29. do i have to pay any consultation fees to use finzo ai's services?": "Typically no. Our advisory services are free for borrowers because we’re compensated by our partner banks when loans are successfully placed. If third-party fees (legal, valuation, etc.) arise, we’ll inform you upfront. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "30. what is a memorandum of transfer (mot) and do i need one?": "A Memorandum of Transfer is the legal instrument transferring property ownership from the seller to the buyer. It needs to be stamped and lodged at the Land Office. For new properties under a master title, a Deed of Assignment might be used instead. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "31. is there a maximum age limit for borrowers applying for a home loan?": "Most banks require the loan to end by age 65 or 70. If you’re older, your loan tenure may be shorter, leading to higher monthly installments. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "32. how can i secure a higher margin of financing?": "Maintain a good credit record, stable income, and low debt. Joint applications can combine incomes. Having existing deposits or investments with the bank may also help. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "33. are there any promotions or rebates for loyalty banking customers?": "Yes. Some banks offer preferential rates, fee waivers, or special perks if you maintain certain deposit levels or investment accounts with them. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "34. can i refinance an inherited property?": "Yes, once legal ownership (e.g., Grant of Probate) is settled and the property is in your name. Banks still assess your creditworthiness and property valuation. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "35. what if my property is partially or fully commercial, like soho, sovo, or sofo units?": "These units often classify as commercial, which may mean different interest rates, financing margins, or tenures. Verify the status, as it affects your loan terms. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "36. if i own multiple properties, does it affect my financing terms?": "Owning multiple properties can increase your total debt ratio. Banks may lower your margin of financing or require stronger income proofs. Proper rental management can help offset some concerns. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "37. what steps should i follow after receiving a loan approval?": "1) Review and sign the Letter of Offer. 2) Complete the Loan Agreement with lawyers. 3) If applicable, finalize MRTA/MLTA. 4) Conclude any property transfer (MOT). 5) After disbursement, start monthly repayments.

You can also track via online banking or apps for real-time balances and payment history. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "39. what is a top-up loan, and how does it differ from refinancing?": "A top-up loan increases your current loan amount with the same bank if your property value has risen. Refinancing usually involves an entirely new loan—possibly with another bank. Compare rates, lock-in periods, and fees before deciding. For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "40. how do i get started with finzo ai for my home loan or refinancing?": "Contact us at wa.me/60167177813 or fill out our online form.

For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",
      "41. what are some fun tips or hacks to save on my home loan?": "1) **Bi-weekly payments**: Splitting your monthly installment into two equal payments every two weeks can help lower overall interest. 2) **Occasional lump sums**: Using windfalls like bonuses to pay down principal can reduce interest significantly. 3) **Flexi-loans**: Parking spare cash in a flexi loan account can minimize daily interest charges. Small steps can lead to huge savings in the long run! For further assistance or to start your application, please contact us at wa.me/60167177813.",

  "ms": {
      "1. apa itu pinjaman perumahan (mortgage)?": "Pinjaman perumahan ialah kemudahan pembiayaan oleh bank atau institusi kewangan untuk membantu anda membeli atau membiayai semula hartanah. Anda membayar balik pokok dan faedah melalui ansuran bulanan sehingga 35 tahun atau sehingga umur 70 tahun. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "2. apa itu pembiayaan semula dan mengapa saya perlu pertimbangkannya?": "Pembiayaan semula menggantikan pinjaman rumah sedia ada anda dengan pinjaman baharu — sama ada dengan bank yang sama atau bank lain. Ia bertujuan mendapatkan kadar faedah lebih rendah, bayaran bulanan lebih rendah, atau mengeluarkan tunai daripada nilai hartanah yang meningkat. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "3. bagaimana untuk menyemak kelayakan bagi pinjaman perumahan atau pembiayaan semula?": "Bank menilai skor kredit, kestabilan pendapatan, dan nisbah hutang-pendapatan anda. Mereka juga memeriksa rekod CCRIS (sejarah bayaran balik) dan CTOS (sebarang tindakan undang-undang atau kebankrapan). Rekod kredit yang baik dan pendapatan stabil meningkatkan peluang kelulusan. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "4. dokumen apa yang diperlukan untuk permohonan pinjaman perumahan atau pembiayaan semula?": "Biasanya anda perlukan Perjanjian Jual Beli (atau geran hak milik), dokumen pengenalan (IC/pasport), penyata pendapatan (slip gaji, borang EA), penyata bank (3–6 bulan), dan penyata pinjaman semasa (jika pembiayaan semula). Dokumen tambahan mungkin diperlukan bergantung pada polisi bank. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "5. apakah margin pembiayaan (mof) yang biasa?": "Kebanyakan bank menawarkan margin pembiayaan antara 70% hingga 90%, dan kadangkala 100% untuk skim tertentu. Margin sebenar bergantung pada profil kredit, jenis hartanah, dan dasar bank. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "6. bagaimana kadar faedah berfungsi (tetap vs. terapung)?": "Kadar tetap (fixed) kekal sepanjang tempoh tertentu (misalnya 2–5 tahun), memberikan ansuran bulanan yang konsisten. Kadar terapung (floating) bergantung pada BR, BFR, dan sebagainya, yang boleh berubah mengikut keadaan pasaran. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "7. bagaimana blr, br, bfr, dan opr mempengaruhi kadar faedah pinjaman saya?": "Bank menggunakan Kadar Asas (BR) atau Kadar Pinjaman/Pembiayaan Asas (BLR/BFR) sebagai rujukan. OPR (Overnight Policy Rate) yang ditetapkan oleh Bank Negara Malaysia mempengaruhi BR. Jika OPR berubah, bank boleh melaras BR, seterusnya mempengaruhi kadar pinjaman anda. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "8. apakah julat kadar faedah di malaysia?": "Secara umum, kadar faedah sekitar 3.0% hingga 4.5% setahun, bergantung pada keadaan pasaran dan profil peminjam. Promosi atau pakej khas mungkin menawarkan kadar lebih rendah. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "9. berapa lama proses permohonan atau pembiayaan semula biasanya diambil?": "Ia lazimnya mengambil masa 1 hingga 3 bulan, bergantung kepada kelengkapan dokumen, penilaian kredit, penilaian hartanah, dan proses guaman. Kami bekerjasama rapat dengan bank dan peguam untuk mempercepatkan kelulusan. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "10. apakah yuran yang perlu dijangka untuk memohon pinjaman perumahan atau pembiayaan semula?": "Yuran termasuk yuran guaman (0.5%–1% mengikut skala), duti setem (0.5% daripada jumlah pinjaman), yuran penilaian, dan caj pemprosesan bank (jika ada). Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "11. bagaimana dengan pakej zero entry cost (zec) atau pembiayaan yuran guaman?": "Sesetengah bank menawarkan pakej Zero Entry Cost (ZEC), yang meliputi yuran guaman/penilaian, atau membolehkan anda membiayainya dalam jumlah pinjaman. Kadar faedah mungkin sedikit lebih tinggi, tetapi anda dapat kurangkan kos pendahuluan. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "12. apa itu tempoh lock-in dan mengapa ia penting?": "Tempoh lock-in (2–5 tahun) ialah tempoh di mana anda dikenakan penalti sekiranya menyelesaikan atau membiayai semula pinjaman lebih awal (biasanya peratusan daripada baki pinjaman). Penting untuk diambil kira jika anda bercadang menjual hartanah atau membuat pembiayaan semula dalam masa terdekat. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "13. apakah itu mrta/mlta dan adakah saya betul-betul memerlukannya?": "MRTA (Mortgage Reducing Term Assurance) menurun seiring baki pinjaman, manakala MLTA (Mortgage Level Term Assurance) mengekalkan perlindungan pada tahap yang sama. Kedua-duanya melindungi anda atau waris daripada tanggungan pinjaman sekiranya anda meninggal dunia atau hilang upaya kekal. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "14. adakah terdapat perbezaan antara pinjaman konvensional dan pembiayaan islamik?": "Ya. Pinjaman konvensional mengenakan faedah, manakala pembiayaan Islamik mengikuti prinsip Syariah (contohnya perkongsian untung atau sewaan). Kedua-duanya boleh menawarkan kadar kompetitif, tetapi struktur dan dokumen guaman berbeza. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "15. bagaimana saya boleh meningkatkan peluang kelulusan jika skor kredit saya lemah?": "Bayar bil tepat pada masanya untuk meningkatkan skor CCRIS, kurangkan hutang sedia ada, dan pertimbang permohonan bersama dengan pasangan atau ahli keluarga. Nisbah hutang-pendapatan yang baik turut membantu. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "16. apa jika permohonan saya ditolak? bolehkah saya memohon semula?": "Ya. Anda perlu tangani isu yang menyebabkan penolakan—misalnya hutang yang tinggi, kredit lemah, atau pendapatan tidak mencukupi—dan cuba semula selepas memperbaiki profil kewangan anda. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "17. bolehkah saya membuat pembayaran separa atau penuh terhadap pinjaman saya?": "Boleh. Anda boleh selesaikan sebahagian (partial) atau keseluruhan (full) untuk mengurangkan pokok dan faedah keseluruhan. Periksa sama ada terdapat tempoh lock-in atau penalti. (Tip seronok: pembayaran tambahan di awal tempoh pinjaman boleh menjimatkan banyak kos faedah jangka panjang!) Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "18. apakah pakej pinjaman full-flexi dan semi-flexi?": "Full-flexi membolehkan anda memasukkan lebihan tunai pada bila-bila masa untuk mengurangkan faedah, dan anda boleh mengeluarkannya semula dengan mudah. Semi-flexi pula sama konsep tetapi mungkin perlukan prosedur tambahan atau caj tertentu. Sesuai untuk mereka dengan pendapatan berubah atau lebihan wang. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "19. bagaimana proses penilaian hartanah dijalankan, dan mengapa ia penting?": "Penilai bertauliah akan menilai nilai pasaran berdasarkan lokasi, transaksi serupa dan keadaan hartanah. Bank membiayai berdasarkan harga belian atau nilai penilaian, mana yang lebih rendah. Jika nilai penilaian rendah, anda perlu menampung perbezaan secara tunai. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "20. bolehkah saya mengeluarkan tunai (cash-out refinancing)?": "Ya. Jika nilai pasaran hartanah anda melebihi baki pinjaman, anda boleh pinjam lebih dan ambil lebihan itu sebagai tunai. Bank akan menilai keupayaan pembayaran balik dan penilaian hartanah sebelum meluluskan. Untuk maklumat lanjut atau memulakan permohonan, sila hubungi kami di wa.me/60167177813.",
      "21. jika saya sudah mempunyai pinjaman rumah, bolehkah saya menukar bank untuk dapatkan kadar lebih baik?": "Ya, ini dipanggil pembiayaan semula.
